## Summary
Rock Paper Scissors! is a user vs bot game in which the user chooses either rock, paper, or scissors and their opponent (the bot) chooses randomly from the three options. Each game ends in a win, a loss, or a tie and these scores are tallied up every page session to display the user's score vs the bot's.
